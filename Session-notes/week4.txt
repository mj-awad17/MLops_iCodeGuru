Day - 4

-> Y model save/real time use-case/community use/ kisi kay kabil b hai?
-> when other person not get benefit from u'r model it's worth nothing

Deployment -> model deploy on webApp or DesktopApp
	- user satisfied daily time feedback and daily QA of u'r model
	- webApp integrate some are important things are:
		- Libraries = streamlit, gradio
		   - sir AqibRehman ask Y we use above libraries?
		google search streamlit -> getting start reading staff
		   - 30 days challenge complete course about streamlit proper guideline here in that course.

what is difference between of libraries/framework
framwork - > streamiing the web application on live, to make prototype djando, flask, fastApi
	2 or 4 pages-application - flask
	more than 10 pages - FastApi
	large scale application like 10k pages - Django
libraries -> simple mockups for showing the model testinig by streamlit, gradio

example: when u have simple page u will use streamlit
	when u have 3-5 page then use flask
	large scale pages used django

some people use django due to they have ORM
	ORM is give build-in dashboard

---
The Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) is one of Django's most powerful features, allowing you to interact with your database 
in the same way that you would with SQL. In truth, Django's ORM is essentiallyÂ a pythonic technique to build SQL to query 
and edit your database and obtain results.
