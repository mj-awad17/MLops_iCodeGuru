----Ma'am Rehmana Younis explaining directory----
(Main folder) proj_name
    -(sub-folder) configuration
	-(file) config.py -> there are 2 functions written init: f1, f2
		init.py		# this is cruial. for Linking to other files
   -(sub-folder) Processing
	-(file) data_hand.py
		init.py		# this is cruial. for Linking to other files
   -(sub-folder) Model Training
		init.py		# this is cruial. for Linking to other files
   -(sub-folder) Test
		init.py		# this is cruial. for Linking to other files
   -(file) model.py
		-model.py link to configuration file by like: (from configuration.config imoprt f1)

Concept is Y we created Module & Y we use them?

src all the stages_files in this directory
	Stages like(reading-file, preprocessing,visualiztion, feature-Engineering, Split-data,model-train, model-evaluation)
	Y benfit of these stages..

Assignment:=> make two seperate file with two function and make linked them
