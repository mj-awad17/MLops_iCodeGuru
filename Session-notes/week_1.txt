week 1 || day 2 - https://www.facebook.com/iCodeguru/videos/454133547091032

- What is MLOPs and why we need MLOPs
	- World of ML better data and on e model is not enough when deploying ML models
	  production continous 
	- MLOPs based on ML and operations:
		Automation, Agility, Collaboration, Continous integration and contious delivery
    Agile, SDLC
    - what is DevOps - VC, Jenkins-pipelines
      SDLC (system development life cycle)
	Idea->Requirements->Code it->Test it->Build it package->Depoly->Operation & Monitor
    CI/CD = Continous integration / Continous Deploy
    Version Control (git)
    
   1. Developer commit
   2. Code Buid Artifacts
   3. Code testing (uni-testing)
   4. Code Analysis vulaerability analysis
   5. Deploy change to staging
   6. QA testing
   7. Deploy to Prod
   8. Go live

Database-Backend-Frontend-User

Collection / Gathering data different types of models and different way to collect data 
like IOT, database, dataware house
curate - remove outliers - ensure quality - cleaning - EDA - visualized - PLots
Validate - quality ensure more - relevant data to training model - ensure data is accurate -
 helpful for model to train or something like that
Analyzsis - Pattern finds and Preprosessing - Feature engineering (x...,y)
Train - divide data into 2 parts (20%-testing, 80%-training)
Evaluate - model building
piplines

API - different api's used for collecting the data.
Stages in MLOps
Data collection/managment: The initial stage involves gathering, cleaning, and preprocessing data.
Model Development: Build and train models using the prepared data. This includes selecting algos,
setting hyperparameters, and iterative refining models based on their performance.
Model validation: After development, models are rigorously tested and validated to ensure they meet predefined
metrics and business goals. This typically involves evaluating the model's accuracy performace and bias to ensure
it is reliable and fair.
With respect to ML pipeline feature includes: f1-M=====m2-f2
- Modularization of code
- tracking all experiments including change in code, configuration and parameters
- CI approach to automate pipeplines includes initiatem reviews and approve process.
Model Development: Once Validated, models are deploy to production envioments where they can start providing insights
and predictions in real applications.
- Integrate with exiting app
- Create frontend
- Containerization the application
Model Monitoring: Deploy models are continously monitoring ot detect performance degradation or data drift.
this stage is critical to ensure that themodels rermain effective over time as I/d and env condition change.
- Resource monitoring
- alerts
Model Updating: Depending on the insights gained during monitoring may need to be retrained or fine-tuned with
new data or adjusted to reflect changes in the underlying data patterns.
GOvernace and Compliance: Throught the MLOPs cycle, adherence to regulartory and ethical standards is essesntial.
This includes managing data privacy, model trandperacny, and audit trails to comply with industry and govt. regulation.
