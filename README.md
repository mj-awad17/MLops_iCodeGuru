### Directory Flow 

```

(Main folder) proj_name
  - (sub-folder) configuration

      config.py -> there are 2 functions written init: f1, f2

      init.py # this is cruial. for Linking to other files

  - (sub-folder) Processing

      data_hand.py
      init.py # this is cruial. for Linking to other files

  - (sub-folder) Model Training

      init.py		# this is cruial. for Linking to other files

  - (sub-folder) Test

      init.py		# this is cruial. for Linking to other files

  - (file) model.py

      model.py link to configuration file by like: (from configuration.config imoprt f1)

```
